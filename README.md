        description => q/ Checking for existing 'use strict' /,
        point       => 1,
        target_dir  => [qw( lib/Sample )],
        target_ext  => [qw( pm )],
        blacklist   => [qw( lib/Sample/BlackStrict.pm)],
        except_list => [qw( lib/Sample/PermitNoStrict.pm)],
        coderef     => sub{
            my $text = shift;
            if( $text =~ qr/^\s*use\sstrict/xms ){
                return 1;
            }
            else{
                return ( 0 , "must need 'use strict'");

        description # Just Description
        point       # When you want to have level of issue, you can set some MINOS point here. Default is 1.
        target_dir  # Tests run only under this directory recursive.Default is [lib]
        target_ext  # Tests run for this ext files.Default is [pm]
        blacklist   # If you have file which has already have bad code , you can skip that file by this list.
        except_list # If you have file which should be  permitted. you & calculator can skip that file by this list.
        coderef     # Rule is written here. you can get target file text as first parameter.
                    # If $text is valid, have to be returned 1(TRUE).
                    # Invalid case has to be return list
                    #   First   : 0(FALSE)
